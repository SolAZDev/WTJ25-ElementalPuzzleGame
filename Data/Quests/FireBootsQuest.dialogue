Fae of Fire: Wanderer, don't forget this wisdom.
% Fae of Fire: Fire teaches us that we ought to toss what doesn't serve us into the fire, to make space for better things
% Fae of Fire: Fire teaches us that there ought to be a balance between passion, and what we want to create.
% Fae of Fire: My guy, tu estas bien? Con estos calores, a ti no te dan ganas de baÃ±arte?
% Fae of Fire: La de agua me dijo que te dijera que tu cara es una canoa.
Fae of Fire: Meditation is a great way to put this into practice
